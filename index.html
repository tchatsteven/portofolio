            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, my name is Steeve Tchatchouang and I'm a software developer based
                in Kitchener, Ontario. I have experience working with a range of
                programming languages, including C#, C/C++, Typescript, Python, Dart,
                SQL, and NoSQL, and frameworks such as Flutter. I am passionate about
                creating efficient and scalable code that meets the needs of clients.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer, basketball, volleyball, and
                dancing, as well as travelling to new places.
            </p>
